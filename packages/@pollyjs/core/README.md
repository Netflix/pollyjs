Polly.JS is a standalone, framework agnostic, JavaScript library that enables recording, replaying, and stubbing HTTP interactions.

By combining the ideas behind Ruby's [VCR](https://github.com/vcr/vcr) with a client side Express-like server, Polly taps into native browser implementations to record, replay, and stub network requests and responses –— allowing for mocking APIs with as little as __one line of code__.

- ⚡️️ Simple, Powerful, & Intuitive API
- 💎 First Class Mocha & QUnit Test Helpers
- 🔥 Intercept, Pass-Through, and Attach Events
- 📼 Record to Disk or Local Storage
- ⏱ Slow Down or Speed Up Time

## Installation

_Note that you must have node (and npm) installed._

```bash
npm install @pollyjs/core -D
```

If you want to install it with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com):

## Getting Started

Check out the [Quick Start](https://netflix.github.io/pollyjs/#/quick-start) documentation to get started.

## Usage

Lets take a look at what an example test case would look like using Polly.

```js
import { Polly } from '@pollyjs/core';

describe('Netflix Homepage', function() {
  it('should be able to sign in', async function() {
    /*
      Create a new polly instance.

      By default, Polly will connect to both fetch and XHR browser APIs and
      will record any requests that it hasn't yet seen while replaying ones it
      has already recorded.
    */
    const polly = new Polly('Sign In');
    const { server } = polly;

    /* Intercept all Google Analytic requests and respond with a 200 */
    server
      .get('/google-analytics/*path')
      .intercept((req, res) => res.sendStatus(200));

    /* Pass-through all GET requests to /coverage */
    server.get('/coverage').passthrough();

    /* start: pseudo test code */
    await visit('/login');
    await fillIn('email', 'polly@netflix.com');
    await fillIn('password', '@pollyjs');
    await submit();
    /* end: pseudo test code */

    expect(location.pathname).to.equal('/browse');

    /*
      Calling `stop` will persist requests as well as disconnect from any
      connected browser APIs (e.g. fetch or XHR).
    */
    await polly.stop();
  });
});
```
