Polly.JS is a standalone, framework-agnostic JavaScript library that enables
recording, replaying, and stubbing HTTP interactions.

Polly taps into native browser APIs to mock requests and responses with little to no
configuration while giving you the ability to take full control of each request with
a simple, powerful, and intuitive API.

## Why Polly?

Keeping fixtures and factories in parity with your APIs can be a time consuming process.
Polly alleviates this by recording and maintaining actual server responses without foregoing flexibility.

- Record your test suite's HTTP interactions and replay them during future test runs for fast, deterministic, accurate tests.
- Use Polly's client-side server to modify or intercept requests and responses to simulate different application states (e.g. loading, error, etc.).

## Features

- 🚀 Fetch & XHR Support
- ⚡️️ Simple, Powerful, & Intuitive API
- 💎 First Class Mocha & QUnit Test Helpers
- 🔥 Intercept, Pass-Through, and Attach Events
- 📼 Record to Disk or Local Storage
- ⏱ Slow Down or Speed Up Time

## Installation

_Note that you must have node (and npm) installed._

```bash
npm install @pollyjs/core -D
```

If you want to install it with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com):

```bash
yarn add @pollyjs/core -D
```

## Getting Started

Check out the [Quick Start](https://netflix.github.io/pollyjs/#/quick-start) documentation to get started.

## Usage

Lets take a look at what an example test case would look like using Polly.

```js
import { Polly, FetchAdapter, XHRAdapter, RESTPersister } from '@pollyjs/core';

/*
  Register the adapters and persisters we want to use. This way all future
  polly instances can access them by name.
*/
Polly.register(XHRAdapter)
Polly.register(FetchAdapter)
Polly.register(RESTPersister)

describe('Netflix Homepage', function() {
  it('should be able to sign in', async function() {
    /*
      Create a new polly instance.

      By default, Polly will connect to both fetch and XHR browser APIs and
      will record any requests that it hasn't yet seen while replaying ones it
      has already recorded.
    */
    const polly = new Polly('Sign In', {
      adapters: ['xhr', 'fetch'],
      persister: 'rest'
    });
    const { server } = polly;

    /* Intercept all Google Analytic requests and respond with a 200 */
    server
      .get('/google-analytics/*path')
      .intercept((req, res) => res.sendStatus(200));

    /* Pass-through all GET requests to /coverage */
    server.get('/coverage').passthrough();

    /* start: pseudo test code */
    await visit('/login');
    await fillIn('email', 'polly@netflix.com');
    await fillIn('password', '@pollyjs');
    await submit();
    /* end: pseudo test code */

    expect(location.pathname).to.equal('/browse');

    /*
      Calling `stop` will persist requests as well as disconnect from any
      connected browser APIs (e.g. fetch or XHR).
    */
    await polly.stop();
  });
});
```

The above test case would generate the following recording HAR which Polly will
use to replay the sign-in request/response when the test is rerun:
